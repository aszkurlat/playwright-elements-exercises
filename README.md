# Playwright Elements Exercises

This repository contains my own practice exercises created while learning Playwright automation.  
The examples are inspired by and based on materials from [**jaktestowac.pl**](https://jaktestowac.pl) — an excellent Polish platform for learning software testing and test automation.

These exercises focus on finding elements on a webpage using various locator types such as **role**, **id**, **class**, **data-testid**, and **custom attributes**.

## Source of the Tested Application

The tested demo application comes from the course:

[**Playwright Elements – Key Concepts of Test Automation**](https://jaktestowac.pl/course/playwright-elements/)

which is part of the program:

[**Automated Tests with Playwright**](https://jaktestowac.pl/playwright)

## How to Run the Project Locally

If you want to run the same demo application locally, follow these steps (based on the course setup):

1. **Download** the full course repository or exercise files from [jaktestowac.pl](https://jaktestowac.pl).
2. **Unzip** the project and move it to your working directory (e.g. `Projects`).
3. **Open** the desired section or lesson folder in Visual Studio Code — for example:  
   `/S01/L03_base_selectors_and_locators/`
4. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
